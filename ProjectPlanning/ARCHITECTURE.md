# Technical Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

### Core Systems
- React + TypeScript for UI and game logic
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- WebGL for effects (planned)

### Component Structure
1. Core Components
   - Grid system
   - Player controls
   - Camera management
   - Viewport rendering

2. UI Components
   - Status bars (health, hunger, thirst)
   - Inventory system
   - Chat interface
   - Navigation HUD

3. Game Systems
   - Time system
   - Weather system
   - Resource system
   - Combat system

### State Management
1. Player State
   - Health/hunger/thirst
   - Position
   - Inventory
   - Status effects

2. World State
   - Grid state
   - Resource nodes
   - Structures
   - Weather

3. UI State
   - Window visibility
   - Tooltips
   - Notifications
   - Menu states

## Performance Optimizations

### Rendering
- Viewport-based rendering
- Chunk-based updates
- Memoized components
- CSS transitions for animations

### State Updates
- Selective re-rendering
- State batching
- Computed properties
- Efficient updates

### Asset Loading
- Lazy component loading
- Asset preloading
- Caching strategies
- Progressive loading

## Technical Constraints
- Browser-based implementation
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Local storage for persistence
- Mobile-responsive design

## Development Guidelines
1. Code Organization
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Shared components in `ui` folder
   - Typed interfaces for all data
   - Clear component boundaries

2. Performance
   - Regular performance audits
   - Bundle size monitoring
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Network optimization

3. Testing
   - Unit tests for core logic
   - Component testing
   - Integration tests
   - Performance testing

4. Documentation
   - Code comments
   - Type definitions
   - API documentation
   - System diagrams
