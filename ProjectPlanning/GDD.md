Below is a **comprehensive Game Design Document (GDD)** for a browser-based, grid-oriented PvP game that combines **Slither.io**-style movement and real-time combat with **tile-based** strategy elements reminiscent of *Standard Warfare*. The document also details the **entire user interface (UI) design** explicitly so that no aspect is left to assumption.

# **Game Design Document (GDD)**

## **1. Game Overview**

### 1.1 Title

**Working Title:** **GridRivals**

### 1.2 Genre

- **Real-Time Action/Strategy** (Browser-based)

### 1.3 Platform

- **Web Browser** (Desktop-first, potentially mobile-responsive)
- Built using **React.js** (with minimal animations or visual effects for performance)

### 1.4 High Concept

In **GridRivals**, each player controls a single “block” (their avatar) on a large, scrolling **tile-based map**. Players **move one tile at a time** in real time, gather resources, build or raid bases, and engage in **PvP combat** at close or ranged distances. The map itself is a grid, but the action is immediate—like *Slither.io*, you hold down direction keys and your block moves tile-by-tile. Conflict arises when players find each other on the map, fight for resources, or attack each other’s bases.

---

## **2. Core Gameplay**

### 2.1 Real-Time, Tile-by-Tile Movement

- **Movement Controls:**  
  - The player presses arrow keys (or WASD) to move their avatar (a 1×1 block) one tile at a time.
  - Movement is continuous (no turn-taking), but you still occupy discrete grid cells.
- **Speed & Collision:**  
  - By default, each move (one tile) takes a fraction of a second to complete, e.g. 0.2 seconds.
  - If you collide with walls or map edges, your avatar stops. You can’t occupy the same tile as a wall or another player’s base structure.

### 2.2 Combat

- **Weapon Range & Damage:**
  - **Melee:** Damages any enemy on adjacent tiles (the 8 surrounding cells, if diagonals are allowed).  
  - **Ranged:** Each ranged weapon has a set “range” in tiles (e.g., 2, 3, 4). If an opponent moves within that range (line-of-sight permitting), they take damage with each tile moved (by either party) until they exit the weapon’s range.
- **Line of Sight (LoS):**
  - Obstacles such as walls can block or reduce ranged damage.  
  - Melee damage typically requires no clear line-of-sight beyond adjacency.
- **Damage on Movement:**
  - Combat triggers occur **whenever** you or your target **moves** while in weapon range.  
  - The damage applies instantly each tile you or the opponent traverses within range.

### 2.3 Bases & Raiding

- **Base Structures:**  
  - Players can build walls, doors, or turrets on any owned tile.  
  - A **“Base Core”** item can mark a tile as your owned territory, allowing building permissions to clanmates or yourself.
- **Lockpicking & Raiding:**  
  - Doors can be locked. Opponents can attempt lockpicking if they have special items.  
  - Destruction-based raiding (blowing up walls or doors) is also possible with certain weapons/items.

### 2.4 Resources & Inventory

- **Resource Gathering:**  
  - Resource nodes appear on certain tiles (wood, metal, etc.).  
  - You collect resources by moving your avatar onto the tile and pressing a “gather” button (or automatically if you have the right tool equipped).
- **Inventory & Crafting:**  
  - A small inventory (grid or list format) stores weapons, lockpicks, building materials.  
  - You can craft or upgrade items if you have the required resources.

### 2.5 Stealth & Special Effects

- **Cloaking (Sneak Mode):**  
  - Makes your block invisible on other players’ screens unless they are very close or have detection items.  
  - Used for infiltration or escaping confrontation.
- **Armor:**  
  - Visually alters your block (e.g., thicker outline) and reduces incoming damage or extends your health bar.  
- **Speed Boosts, Decoys, etc.:**  
  - Additional items grant temporary movement speed, drop decoy blocks, or create illusions to confuse enemies.

## **3. Game UI & UX**

In **GridRivals**, the UI is **essential** for clarity—each tile, player block, base structure, and resource node must be immediately recognizable. **Nothing is left to assumption**; every element is explicitly displayed.

### 3.1 Screen Layout

```
 ________________________________
|            TOP BAR             |
|________________________________|
|           LEFT SIDEBAR         |  <---->  [ MAIN GRID AREA ]  <---->  RIGHT SIDEBAR
|________________________________|
|           BOTTOM BAR           |
```

1. **Top Bar** – Displays key player info (health, resources, username).
2. **Left Sidebar** – Contains **map navigation** or **chat** (configurable).
3. **Main Grid Area** – The **central focus**, rendering the tile-based world.
4. **Right Sidebar** – Houses **inventory**, **equipment** details, or expansions as needed.
5. **Bottom Bar** – Minimap toggle, or quick item slots, or game status messages.

> **Note:** The layout is flexible. You can swap sidebars or move the chat. But the principle remains: the grid is always central, with key info organized around it.

### 3.2 Main Grid Area

- **Primary View**: A large scrollable grid.  
  - Each cell is a square of uniform size (e.g., 40×40 px).  
  - The **player avatar** is a colored square that remains near the center of the viewport if possible.  
  - **Scrolling/Panning**: If you move near the edge, the camera smoothly pans so that your avatar stays visible.  
- **Tile Graphics**:  
  - **Empty Tiles**: A simple dark or neutral color.  
  - **Base Structures** (Walls, Doors, Turrets): Displayed as icons or partial overlay shapes. For instance:
    - Wall tile = thick vertical/horizontal line across the tile  
    - Door tile = a hinged icon or a partial gap in the wall icon  
    - Turret tile = small turret icon  
  - **Resource Nodes**: A small icon (wood, ore, etc.) that indicates gatherable resources.  
- **Player Avatars**:  
  - **Your Avatar**: A highlighted or outlined square.  
  - **Allied Avatars**: Possibly a green outline.  
  - **Enemy/Neutral Avatars**: Red or gray squares.  
  - **Cloaked Players**: Either invisible or a faint outline (depending on your detection items).

#### Movement Indicators

- When you press a direction key (e.g., “W”), your avatar instantly attempts to move one tile up. If the tile is free, your block slides into it.  
- The **camera** pans slightly, maintaining your avatar near the center.

### 3.3 Top Bar

**Suggested Layout** (from left to right):

1. **Game Title / Logo** – “GridRivals” or your brand name.  
2. **Player Name & Health** – Text label with a small health bar or numeric HP.  
3. **Resources & Currency** – Show how much wood, metal, or universal currency you hold. This might be displayed as small icons with a numeric total.  
4. **Settings / Account Menu** – A button or drop-down for game settings (sound, graphics, keybinds) and user account actions (profile, logout).

> **No assumptions:** The user can see exactly how many resources they have at any given time. Health is clearly indicated to help them gauge survival.

### 3.4 Sidebars

**Left Sidebar** (example functionalities):

- **Chat Panel:**  
  - A vertical list of messages.  
  - **Chat Input Box** at the bottom.  
  - Tabs: “Global Chat,” “Clan Chat,” “Private Messages.”  

- **Map Navigation Buttons** (optional if using arrow keys to pan):  
  - Large arrow icons to scroll the main grid if a user doesn’t want to use keyboard.

**Right Sidebar** (example functionalities):

1. **Inventory / Equipment**  
   - A grid or list of items you possess (weapons, lockpicks, consumables).  
   - **Equip Slots**: Show which weapon or armor you have equipped.  
   - Drag-and-drop items from your inventory to equip them.  
2. **Player Stats & Buffs**  
   - A small panel that lists your current armor rating, stealth status, or any active effects (“Speed Boost,” “Poisoned,” etc.).
3. **Base Management** (if you own one)  
   - Quick summary of your Base Core’s location, door status, turret ammo levels, etc.  
   - Possibly collapsible if you want more screen space.

### 3.5 Bottom Bar

1. **Minimap Toggle**  
   - A button that opens or closes a small overlay map showing your position and major landmarks or discovered areas.  
2. **Action Buttons / Quick Slots**  
   - 1–6 slots for quick-use items (e.g., health kits, bombs).  
   - Each slot shows an icon and quantity.

### 3.6 Pop-Up Windows / Overlays

- **Context Menus**: When you right-click (or press a special button) on a tile or an object (like a door), a small contextual menu might appear with actions: “Lockpick,” “Open Door,” “Attack,” etc.  
- **Loot Windows**: If you open a chest or kill a player, a pop-up inventory shows possible loot.  
- **Crafting Window**: If you click “Craft” in your inventory, a modal appears listing available recipes.

### 3.7 Accessibility & Visual Cues

- **Damage / Combat Indicators**:  
  - Whenever damage occurs, a small red flash or text (“-5 HP”) appears near your avatar or the enemy.  
- **Sound Icons / Chat Alerts**:  
  - If sound is off, a small icon could appear whenever you get a chat message.  
- **Color Blind-Friendly Palettes**:  
  - Make sure tile colors and avatar outlines use distinct shapes or patterns if color alone isn’t enough.

## **4. Progression & Balance**

### 4.1 No Massive Level Gaps

- The game focuses on **player skill** and strategic choice of gear.  
- **Gear** can grant small advantages (range +1, damage +5, etc.), but nothing so large that a new player is useless.

### 4.2 Resource Distribution

- Resource nodes are **scattered** across the map, encouraging exploration and conflict.  
- The minimap (or a discovered map) shows known node positions once you have scouted them.

### 4.3 Base Building

- Defenses must be carefully positioned on the grid.  
- The overhead view in the main grid area shows exactly how walls connect or how big your base is.  
- Having *too large* a base might be hard to defend if you don’t have enough clanmates or turrets.

---

## **5. Social Features**

### 5.1 Clans / Alliances

- **Clan Membership**:  
  - Appears next to your name in the top bar or near your avatar.  
  - Allies can see each other’s position on the minimap.  
  - Allied tiles or bases have a special outline or color code.

### 5.2 Chat & Notifications

- Real-time text chat in the left sidebar.  
- **Attack Alerts**: If your base is under attack, a pop-up and possibly a sound or flashing icon warns you.

---

## **6. Technical Implementation Notes**

### 6.1 React UI Rendering

- **Grid Rendering**:  
  - Each tile is a React component or a simple `<div>` with CSS grid styling.  
  - The camera “follows” the player by adjusting the portion of the grid that’s rendered or by smoothly scrolling in CSS.

### 6.2 Real-Time Updates

- **WebSockets** or similar for updating player positions and combat in real time.  
- The server tracks each move, then broadcasts position changes to nearby players.

### 6.3 Database / Persistence

- **Player Inventory**, **Base Layout** are stored in a database.  
- On re-login, your avatar is placed where you last logged out (or at a spawn/base if killed).

---

## **7. Game Loop Summary**

1. **Spawn**  
   - The player appears on the grid at a neutral or clan base.  
2. **Explore / Gather**  
   - Move around tile-by-tile, collect resources, keep an eye out for other players.  
3. **Build / Upgrade**  
   - Use resources to construct or fortify a base; equip better gear from your inventory.  
4. **Encounter / Combat**  
   - Spot an enemy. If within weapon range, each tile moved results in damage. Attempt to chase or evade.  
5. **Raid / Defend**  
   - Attack enemy bases or defend your own. Use lockpicks, stealth, or brute-force to breach.  
6. **Progress / Expand**  
   - Acquire rarer items, possibly join or form a clan, and stake out more territory.

---

## **8. Why This UI Is Clear and Comprehensive**

1. **Central Grid**: Always shows the battlefield. All environment interactions happen here—moving, gathering, fighting.  
2. **Sidebars**: Keep non-movement tasks organized (chat, inventory, clan info).  
3. **Top & Bottom Bars**: Present crucial data at a glance (health, resources, quick item slots, minimap toggle).  
4. **No Hidden Assumptions**:  
   - Each structure is depicted on the grid.  
   - Each inventory item is shown in a list or grid format.  
   - Combat ranges are indicated by tile distance, so players see or estimate exactly how far they can attack or be attacked.

---

## **9. Future Enhancements**

- **Advanced Base Modules**: Sentry turrets, auto-gatherers, advanced walls.  
- **More Player Abilities**: Teleportation pads, short-range leaps, AoE bombs.  
- **Events / Boss Mobs**: Randomly spawning NPC threats or “boss” tiles to fight for unique loot.

# **Conclusion**

**GridRivals** merges **classic tile-based clarity** with **real-time movement** and **fast-paced PvP** reminiscent of *Slither.io*. By carefully designing a UI that **explicitly shows** all relevant information—player positions, inventory items, base layouts, and resource counts—the game ensures **accessibility** for newcomers and **strategic depth** for veterans. The end result is a **browser-based** experience that balances **simplicity**, **tactical gameplay**, and **thrilling encounters** on every tile.
